    "Before we get started, it's important to talk about what a relational database is. A relational database effectivelly a collection of different tables that are connected together through keys. Effectively, each table will have \"keys\" that connect the columns in one table to another table, by matching the values in the key columns. Some databases are structred in a proper table format while other database systems will masqerade themselves as collection of tables.\n",

    "See below for an example of a entity relationhip diagram (ERD) that demonstrates a collection of tables and how they relate to one another. In this context, how a bookstore might set up their database. Each box represents a table. The items in the box represents each column contained therein. The key symbol represents the primary key for each table, and the lines show the relationships between tables.\n",
